Cycles
======
Cycles is a daily time-step agroecosystem model that simulates the biophysical processes and management practices occurring within cropping systems and other landuses.
Processes include fluxes in the water and energy balance, the coupled cycling of carbon and nitrogen, and plant growth. The model can simulate a wide range of agricultural management practices such as tillage, organic and inorganic nutrient additions, annual and perennial crops, crop harvests as grain or forages, polycultures and relay cropping, grazing, and irrigation.
Crop growth is represented with a generalizable framework such that a nearly limitless variety of agricultural crop species can be specified by the user.
A *user reference guide* for Cycles is provided at [PSUModeling.GitHub.io/Cycles/](https://psumodeling.github.io/Cycles/).

This repository is used to release Cycles executables and track issues.
All versions of Cycles releases can be found at the [release page](https://github.com/PSUmodeling/Cycles/releases).
Please submit all bug reports and feature requests using the [Issues tab](https://github.com/PSUmodeling/Cycles/issues).
